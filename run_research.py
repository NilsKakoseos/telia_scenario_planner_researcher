    "Scenario 1: Blue - US-Dominated Global Monopoly": """
    - Global, deregulated US-based corporate monopoly
    Title: Us-dominated global monopoly of cutting edge AI continuing along current trends with strong competition between a few large US-based corporations driving innovation (pretty much a projection on the current status quo of AI within the world, projecting these existing visible trends)
    """,
    "Scenario 2: Green - Globally Regulated AI for Scientific Progress": """
    Title: AI regulated towards scientific progress to solve global issues
    - Global, regulated, centralised at local regulatory levels (e.g. at EU, eurasia, US, latin america)
    On a global central level is determined to allocate AI-compute towards solving the most impactful scientific challenges of the world, including energy-production, combatting climate disruption and providing strong secure models of risk-prediction and mitigation concerning extreme weather events, extreme economic events, extreme war events etc etc. All digital services will be tracked in detail and carbon-footprints measured all the way from energy production, AI-hardware components production including mining of minerals and materials, all the way to the digital products utilising this underlying compute infrastructure in serving their customer basis in markets, which are also evaluated on detailed carbon-emission standards within the globally regulated regulatory framework for AI.
    """,
    "Scenario 3: Yellow - De-globalised, Heavily Regulated AI": """
    - local (on EU-level, de-globalised world), regulated,
    Title: Centralised and heavily regulated AI in a de-globalised world.
    European stake holders will rely heavily on tight regulations on the EU-level heavily regulating all digital AI service providers. There will be usage-limits on AI-compute for individual users. A strong fear of AI technology regulates the usage of AI in digital products both on a (decentralised, local) legal level and on the level of customer demands.
    """,
    "Scenario 4: Red - Decentralised Acceleration Towards AGI": """
    - deregulated, decentralised, global
    Title: Decentralised global acceleration towards AGI within 2 years
    - Decentralized open-source together with big corporate players drives the innovation towards sci-fi level exponential progress to AGI within 2 years. The web continuously builds itself with new builds continuously deployed and updated to ever-new multimodal interfaces and digital touchpoints quickly specialised and personalised to corporate business and customer needs. A small globally decentralized elite of individuals and few-person companies with access to AI technology have unbounded opportunity to shape the digital world. At the same time, AI-systems becomes increasingly autonomous, and we are starting to actually see some signs of strong competitions in digital markets for autonomous AI-systems with no clear human stakeholder involved. This will heavily reshape the web landscape, and products are radically quicker iterated and deployed. At the same time the whole web infrastructure is rapidly changing on a lower physical level to support the rapidly evolving needs of the web, and is merging with IOT and physical infrastructure streamlined to local business needs around the world. There is a battle between this decentralised trend and the powerful cloud-based monopolies still existing and growing even stronger on their big monopolies of datastreams and high-fidelity AI-models. Out of this conflict between centralised global cloud providers and rapidly evolving local decentralised and partly autonomous AI-products is shaping the landscape of the world wide web and the world more broadly, towards artificial super intelligence. Will it be one giant AI, or a collectively super-intelligent ecology of trillions of specialised swarms of and individual AIs with beyond-human super powers to drive the evolution of the world?
