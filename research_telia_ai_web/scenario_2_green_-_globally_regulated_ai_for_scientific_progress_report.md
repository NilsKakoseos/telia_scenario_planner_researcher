## Scenario Narrative

The establishment of a globally regulated AI framework focused on scientific progress is envisioned to address substantial global challenges such as climate change and carbon footprint management. In this scenario, AI is not merely a tool but a globally coordinated initiative intended to lend computational power to solving the most pressing issues of our time.

AI can enhance our understanding of climate science and its implications. Research suggests that AI applications can significantly improve climate modeling accuracy, leading to timely predictions of extreme weather events and financial risks in potentially unstable regions[^1^][^6^]. By leveraging AI, governments can allocate compute resources to fields projected to yield the highest impact, such as sustainable energy solutions and biodiversity conservation. Adaptive strategies prompted by AI insights could mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by optimizing energy use and enhancing environmental management programs[^7^][^12^].

Furthermore, tracking and managing the carbon footprint of AI systems is crucial within this framework. A comprehensive AI management system must assess energy consumption and embodied emissions, linking operational processes to sustainable practices[^9^][^10^]. By integrating data from AI applications on emissions reduction, stakeholders may better coordinate efforts and establish a robust platform for progressive environmental initiatives[^3^][^11^]. This structured, global approach can foster a collaborative environment, ensuring that AI technologies directly contribute to scientific advancements and sustainable development goals.

## Key Drivers and Indicators

The global regulation of AI for scientific progress is significantly driven by technological advancements, international policy frameworks, and the urgent need to address climate change. AI is revolutionizing energy production by optimizing renewable resources, thereby enhancing efficiency and reliability in the face of shifting demand patterns. For instance, AI systems can predict energy production from renewables, allowing grid operators to better manage energy flows and support sustainable transitions [1][6].

Internationally, cohesive policy frameworks are emerging, emphasizing the importance of integrating AI with climate action. The UN’s initiatives underscore the need for inclusive regulations to harness AI's potential for sustainable development while mitigating associated risks [3][6]. Similarly, the EU’s regulatory efforts aim to create structured guidelines that promote responsible AI use, focusing on environmental sustainability and ethical practices [4][6].

Key indicators of progress include the establishment of comprehensive AI laws across jurisdictions prioritizing carbon footprint reduction and sustainability [7]. Countries are increasingly recognizing AI's potential long-term impacts, indicating a shift toward integrating green practices into AI development [2][6]. These interconnected factors highlight the necessity for global cooperation to ensure that AI advances scientific progress while effectively tackling climate challenges.

## Implications for Telia (Technical)

In the context of a globally regulated AI ecosystem aimed at scientific progress, Telia faces both significant technical challenges and opportunities. With the directive to allocate AI resources towards tackling pressing global issues such as climate change and energy production, the company must adapt its infrastructure to align with evolving regulatory frameworks and energy conservation standards.

One primary challenge lies in the shift to AI-driven data centers, which are anticipated to consume vast amounts of energy—potentially making up to 13% of total U.S. electricity consumption by 2030[8]. Given that single AI models can consume energy equivalent to what several households use in a year[7], Telia must implement energy-efficient technologies, like renewable energy sources and advanced cooling systems, to mitigate operational carbon footprints. Transitioning to sustainable engineering practices becomes non-negotiable, emphasizing the importance of using AI not only for technological advancement but also for minimizing ecological impact[10][13].

Additionally, the regulatory landscape will require Telia to adhere to strict data privacy and energy consumption regulations, necessitating robust compliance mechanisms within its AI-driven services. This not only demands upgrading existing infrastructure but also offers an opportunity to become a leader in providing sustainable and innovative AI solutions that align with global climate goals, potentially carving out a competitive advantage in the telecommunications sector[12][15].

## Implications for Telia (Product Design)

To align with the globally regulated framework for AI, Telia's B2C web product design must adapt to integrate AI-driven solutions that emphasize sustainability and ethical practices. The EU AI Act, which categorizes AI systems based on risk, is a critical regulatory development that Telia must consider, as it mandates compliance for any AI products utilized within the union [11][12]. This necessitates products with enhanced transparency and user control, enabling customers to understand how their data is used.

Moreover, Telia's sustainability initiatives, such as its commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040, will significantly influence product design choices. Features that actively reduce energy consumption and carbon footprints should be prioritized, as Telia's solutions can play a vital role in shaping a low-carbon future [6][10]. By incorporating AI-based feedback systems, Telia can offer personalized services that not only enhance user experience but also encourage sustainable practices among consumers.

Additionally, in adapting to the evolving landscape of AI regulation, Telia will benefit from applying a risk-based approach to its product offerings, ensuring compliance and safety in critical applications [14][15]. This dual focus on regulatory alignment and environmental responsibility will ultimately reinforce Telia's market position as a leader in ethical tech.

## Risks and Opportunities

The globally regulated AI scenario presents Telia with significant risks and opportunities. Internally, adopting AI technologies could streamline operations and offer enhanced services tailored for scientific progress and sustainability. AI's potential for cost reduction and operational efficiency is notable, particularly with capabilities like predictive analytics in managing network resources effectively, potentially leading to savings of up to 20% in capital expenses (CapEx) and 25% in operational expenses (OpEx) in telecommunications (Source 2). 

However, the risks associated with AI are equally critical. The regulatory landscape surrounding AI is evolving rapidly, with requirements mandating transparency, accountability, and adherence to strict environmental standards projected by the EU AI Act (Source 2, Source 3). Failure to comply could lead to significant penalties and reputational damage. Moreover, AI systems can introduce complexity in decision-making processes, leading to potential biases if not implemented carefully (Source 4). 

Additionally, the high energy consumption of AI technologies raises concerns about carbon footprints, making it imperative for Telia to establish sustainable practices in line with emerging environmental regulations (Source 6, Source 9). Addressing these challenges while seizing the transformative potential of AI will be essential in positioning Telia as a leader in the telecommunications sector.
