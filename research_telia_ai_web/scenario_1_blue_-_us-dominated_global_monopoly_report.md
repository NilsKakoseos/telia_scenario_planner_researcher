## Scenario Narrative

The persistent monopoly on AI by U.S. tech giants has profound implications for both innovation and competition. Between 2021 and 2023, around 66% of AI acquisitions occurred within the U.S., predominantly involving firms like Google and Microsoft, reinforcing American dominance in the sector [1]. This concentration has fostered an environment where innovation is tightly controlled, effectively allowing a handful of corporations to dictate the landscape of AI development, resulting in potential inefficiencies in resource allocation and stifled competition [2]. 

Moreover, the regulatory focus has shifted toward enabling these companies to expand their capabilities while simultaneously addressing antitrust concerns. The Department of Justice has allowed Google to maintain its investments in AI despite ongoing anti-competitive scrutiny, a decision that signifies a complex balancing act between fostering innovation and curbing monopolistic practices [11]. As AI becomes increasingly critical to various sectors, it is essential that competition policies ensure public benefit and prevent exploitation by a few dominant players [2][12]. Without robust interventions to regulate these monopolistic tendencies, the global AI landscape risks becoming a subdued arena, favorable predominately to U.S. corporate interests at the expense of broader innovation and economic opportunity.
