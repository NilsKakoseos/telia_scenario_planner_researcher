## Scenario Narrative

The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act), which took effect on August 1, 2024, marks a significant shift toward stringent regulation of AI technologies in a de-globalized context. In this heavily regulated environment, European stakeholders face unique challenges as they adapt to the Act's risk-based approach to AI governance. The Act categorizes AI applications into four risk levels—unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal—each invoking varying degrees of regulatory scrutiny and compliance obligations aimed at protecting fundamental rights and promoting ethical AI practices [1][2].

Challenges arise with the high-risk category, which encompasses AI applications in sectors like healthcare and law enforcement that significantly impact individuals' rights and safety. These systems must adhere to strict requirements, including ongoing human oversight, comprehensive documentation, and conformity assessments to mitigate risks and ensure accountability [3][12]. Additionally, the Act's extraterritorial scope demands compliance from non-EU entities whose AI systems are deployed within the EU, complicating global AI operations amid fears of potential penalties up to 7% of annual global revenue for noncompliance [4][7].

As the EU seeks to foster innovation while safeguarding its citizens, the AI Act presents a dual challenge: balancing the need for strict oversight with the imperative to drive technological advancement [5][12]. This regulatory framework is intended not just to govern but to instill confidence in AI by maintaining ethical standards [11].

## Key Drivers and Indicators

The emergence of heavily regulated AI in a de-globalised European context is driven by multiple factors, with safety, ethical concerns, and local compliance at the forefront. The European Union's landmark AI Act, effective from August 2024, aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework, categorizing AI systems based on their risk levels. This risk-based approach mandates stringent compliance measures for high-risk AI applications, especially in sensitive areas like healthcare and transport, while promoting transparency and accountability throughout the lifecycle of AI technologies【1】【2】【6】. 

Additionally, public sentiment towards AI reflects a strong apprehension regarding the technology's potential misuse, leading to heightened consumer demand for regulatory assurances【4】【5】. The insistence on ethical AI deployment aligns with the EU's broader strategic goals of promoting technological sovereignty and competitiveness【7】. Quantifiable indicators to track these shifts may include the number of AI compliance cases reported, public trust metrics in AI systems, and trends in local innovation against regulatory burdens【3】【12】【10】. Monitoring these indicators will provide crucial insights into the evolving landscape of AI regulation and its impact on both market dynamics and public safety within the European Union.

## Implications for Telia (Technical)

In the de-globalised context defined by the EU's stringent AI regulations, Telia faces notable technical challenges and opportunities regarding its infrastructure and internal systems. The newly introduced AI Act mandates a comprehensive compliance framework for AI technologies, emphasizing uniformity in legal standards across EU member states[1][2]. This creates a substantial requirement for Telia to ensure that all AI systems and services align with the risk-based classifications outlined in the Act.

One significant challenge will be the need for robust compliance systems capable of categorising AI applications based on their inherent risk levels, which range from low to high risk[1][3]. High-risk systems, such as those utilized in critical infrastructure and public services, must adhere to extensive monitoring and reporting requirements. Non-compliance could lead to severe penalties, prompting Telia to invest in compliance technology and processes immediately[2][4].

Conversely, this regulatory landscape also presents opportunities for Telia to redefine its AI service offerings and enhance AI literacy among stakeholders. By proactively adopting transparent AI models and ensuring algorithmic accountability, Telia can position itself as a leader in responsible AI deployment, building trust among users and stakeholders[3][11].

## Implications for Telia (Product Design)

In a de-globalised world with heavy AI regulation imposed by the EU, Telia's B2C web product designs must adapt to comply with the EU AI Act. The Act categorizes AI systems based on risk, requiring stringent documentation and compliance for high-risk applications, which are pertinent to sectors like healthcare and finance [1][7][9]. This necessitates Telia to establish robust governance frameworks that assure clear documentation, risk management, and continuous monitoring, focusing on user safety and fundamental rights [2][4][10].

User experience will also be crucial, as transparency mandates will require users to be informed when they are interacting with AI. Telia must design interfaces that effectively communicate the functions and limitations of their AI systems [3][6]. Simplifying compliance processes while maintaining user engagement will be essential to prevent overwhelming consumers with regulatory details. Moreover, the integration of EU-compliant technical standards into product design is vital, as it reduces legal risks and bolsters user trust in the reliability of Telia's offerings [5][12][15]. Adapting to these demands will shape Telia's product strategies moving forward.

## Implications for Telia (Business Development)

In a heavily regulated AI environment, Telia must adapt its business strategies to comply with the stringent guidelines imposed by the EU AI Act. This comprehensive legislative framework categorizes AI applications by risk levels, particularly emphasizing robust oversight for high-risk systems, which is particularly relevant for telecom operators given their role in managing critical infrastructure [12][11]. As a key player in telecommunications, Telia needs to align its operations with these compliance requirements while continuing to innovate and deliver value.

Strategic partnerships will become critical for Telia in navigating this regulatory landscape. Collaborating with local tech firms and industry stakeholders can bolster compliance efforts, allowing for sharing of resources and expertise, and aligning with transparency initiatives to ensure ethical AI practices. Joining forces with companies participating in the EU AI Pact could enhance Telia’s market positioning, helping the company gain access to essential data infrastructures while demonstrating a commitment to responsible innovation [4][11][2].

Furthermore, Telia should focus on developing industry-specific solutions and leveraging AI capabilities to maintain competitiveness. By engaging in industry-focused partnerships and adopting a customer-centric approach, Telia can effectively respond to evolving consumer demands and regulatory expectations, positioning itself as a leader in ethical AI deployment within the telecom sector [14][7][8].

## Risks and Opportunities

In a de-globalised and heavily regulated AI landscape, Telia faces both risks and opportunities shaped by stringent European regulations. The EU's Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act enforces compliance based on a risk-based framework, categorizing AI systems by their potential impact and instituting obligations that can be burdensome for companies, particularly for high-risk applications in areas like public safety and privacy protection[1][4][11]. Non-compliance can lead to significant penalties, including fines of up to 7% of global turnover, necessitating that Telia invest heavily in regulatory compliance and risk mitigation strategies[3][5][12].

Conversely, this regulatory framework provides Telia ample opportunities to position itself as a leader in the local AI landscape, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that may struggle with compliance[2][6][9]. Offering tailored AI solutions that adhere to EU regulations could unlock substantial market demand among companies seeking compliant technology. Moreover, the focus on ethical AI practices aligns with growing consumer expectations and could enhance Telia's reputation, fostering loyalty and driving growth in service revenue[4][8][10].

In this evolving environment, Telia must navigate the dual challenge of maintaining regulatory compliance while capitalising on the innovation potential and market leadership in AI solutions driven by its established local infrastructure.
